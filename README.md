# DiscordAntiProfanityBot
An Annoying-ass Bot that Calls out all the lmaos and other ways to trick the original lmao bot. Also an anti profanity filter.
It can also Search Images with the !image command and It Can Also Play Music with the !help commands for a full list of commands.

Its also pretty cool interms of usability. The music functionality is airtight BUT the sound quality could use some work because Node-Opus, Axios, FFMPEG and FFMPEGBinaries use the old version because the code got screwed up when updated and everything concerning the music code failed.

The Image search is airtight and perfect. SafeSearch is implemented so only safe pictures show up when in use.

The lmao code is written so that Lmao, Lmfao, Imao, Imfao, lnao, Inao, and many more cannot be said without the call out

The profanity filter also blocks many curse words by calling it out as well. The curse word deletion scrips is yet to be made

I did kinda borrow code from many other sources to create this Frankenstein's monster of a project
